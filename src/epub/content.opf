		<dc:description id="description">A young, uneducated, and mistreated chimney sweep is reborn as a water-baby, beginning a journey of moral and spiritual growth.</dc:description>
		<meta id="long-description" property="se:long-description" refines="#description">
			&lt;p&gt;Uneducated and regularly mistreated by his master, his filth only matched by his moral and spiritual baseness, Tom is a typical Victorian chimney sweep. While on a special job at a noble’s estate, prejudice pins a crime on him and he flees in fear of retaliation. The chase eventually takes him to a stream in which he bathes for the first time and, doing so, finds himself reborn as a water-baby. Now a denizen of the fairy world, so close yet so alien to ours, Tom begins a journey of moral and spiritual growth. Through the teachings of the fairies, he is made aware of the consequences of his own cruelty and ignorance, for which he learns to own up to, and ultimately understands the importance of doing as he would be done by.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This is the premise of &lt;i&gt;The Water-Babies&lt;/i&gt;, a children’s book written by &lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-kingsley"&gt;Charles Kingsley&lt;/a&gt; in 1863. As a man of the cloth who wrote children fiction and with a taste for science, Kingsley bears similarities with &lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll"&gt;Lewis Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll/alices-adventures-in-wonderland/john-tenniel"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alice’ Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would be published two years after &lt;i&gt;The Water-Babies&lt;/i&gt;. But while Carroll eschewed didacticism, Kingsley embraced it.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Kingsley had a clear moral purpose in writing his book. Like many of his contemporaries, he believed in the importance of providing children with a moral education—the nature thereof being often in contention. In particular, Kingsley clashed with the American author Samuel Goodrich. Goodrich was contemptuous of fantasy and insisted that children be given only facts and taught to reach objective truth through empirical means. Kingsley, in opposition, held that children needed a balanced manner of apprehension: limiting them to mere facts would not automatically provide them with the insight and critical thinking needed to produce anything useful. Fantasy added an element of wonder to education, allowing children to engage and play with ideas, and opening their minds to various, sometimes unconventional, inferences. Goodrich is lampooned in the book as Cousin Cramchild; the consequences of his methods are shown through vegetable children who are “all heads and no bodies”: full of information yet lacking in wisdom and unable to do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Kingsley also had a scientific interest in writing his book. A well-rounded moral education, he thought, required an alliance of faith and science, something he understood as a clergyman. He corresponded with many of the great scientific minds of his time—including Richard Owen, who coined the word “dinosaur.” When critics objected to Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, Kingsley proved one of his most stalwart champions; he praised Darwin for his rigorous research and the open-mindedness that led him to his conclusions. Through &lt;i&gt;The Water-Babies&lt;/i&gt;, Kingsley explored the harmony between faith and science, using fantasy and humour to illustrate his views and introduce children to the scientific method as well as Darwin’s theory of evolution through natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Kingsley’s book also has a literary merit that transcends its moral and scientific aims. &lt;i&gt;The Water-Babies&lt;/i&gt; bears a striking resemblance to the writings of French Renaissance polymath François Rabelais—yet another man of the cloth with a strong interest in science who also happened to write stories. Like Rabelais, Kingsley relied on folklore and fantasy to tell his story; liberally used satire and allegory to voice his outrage at the social conditions of his times, and to promote his ideal educational model; and sprinkled his writing with puns and wordplays—Kingsley shares Rabelais’ penchant for ridiculously long lists, itemising things to the point of the absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;However, The Water-Babies is not just a work of whimsy and fantasy aimed at children. Like Carroll, Kingsley imparted darkness into his work. While he is careful not to shock his intended audience, adults can easily pick up that the water-babies were once children who died from abuse or neglect. Tom leaves his dirty husk behind so his true self can finally be free to wander and wonder, to learn and grow, to find in the afterlife as a fairy what he had been denied in life as a human—a fulfilment of the Christian promise. Under the playfulness of the tale lie the horrors of the Industrial Revolution that forced so many into child labour. Kingsley’s outrage, however, didn’t go unheard: &lt;i&gt;The Water-Babies&lt;/i&gt; became a bestseller, echoing the sentiment of other reformers. The Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act, which aimed to improve the conditions of chimney sweeps, passed a year after the book’s publication. It is no exaggeration to say that Kingsley, through his book, helped to make a difference for many children and young men.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chapter-1: modernize-spelling was prevented from modifying verse in the epigraph

			Chapters 1 and 3 feature several stretched-out words; typogrify incorrectly attempts to change those back to regular hyphens.

			Chapter 2, line 163: Sea-horse is not modernised and keeps the hyphen to not clash with the style of the paragraph.

			Chapter 2, line 166: Water-men is not modernised and keeps the hyphen for the same reason as above.

			Chapter 7: modernize-spelling incorrectly attempts to remove hyphens from a song.

			Several parts, lists in particular, were italicised in the original scans; those italics were dropped in this production. However, there are two sections, in Chapters 1 and 7, that are set at a different indent level and italicised in the original; those were kept.
